## Installing Draft JS Dependencies for Rich Text Editing in React

It's time to start building in our Rich Text Media Editor. We'll use a library called DraftJS.

We need to install four libraries.

```
npm i draft-js react-draft-wysiwyg draftjs-to-html html-to-draftjs
```

## Rendering Draft JS Form Component and Building Rich Text Editor Styles

We'll start by creating a nwe folder in the components folder called forms. Inside of it we're going to create a **rich-text-editor.js** file. Inside of that we're going to create a class component.

We'll write whatever we want and call it from the **blog-forn.js** file. The text will appear inside the modal because the blog-modal file is the root component for the modal and the blog form.

We'll stretch the modal to be bigger. To do that, we can go to the console and see what class it contains, and will aply these styles: 

```
.ReactModal__Content, .ReactModal__Content--after-open {
    height: 80%;
}
```

Inside the **rich-text-editor.js** file we'll import a few libraries.

```
import { EditorState, covertToRaw } from "draft-js";
import { Editor } from "react-draft-wysiwyg";
import draftToHtml from "draftjs-to-html";
import htmlToDraft from "html-to-draftjs";
```

Inside of the constructor we'll pass props, and add state, but not as usual: we'll be calling the editor.

```
 this.state = {
    editorState: EditorState.createEmpty()
 }
```

Now we'll be calling the editor where the h1 tags used to be, and pass props to call the state, among other things:

```
render() {
        return (
        <div>
         <Editor
         editorState={this.state.editorState}
         wrapperClassName='demo-wrapper'
         editorClassName='demo-editor'/>
        </div>
        );
    };
```


> The name here does matter because what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be leveraging the basic styles provided through one of the libraries so these names you're passing in are going to have corresponding styles that are associated and built directly into them. 

Now if we refresh the page and open the modal we'll see a WYSIWYG text editor's icons. Now these need to be styled, but that's what the react-wysiwyg library does. We'll create a new stylesheet and paste [this](https://github.com/jordanhudgens/jordan-hudgens-react-portfolio/blob/master/src/style/react-draft-wysiwyg.scss) in.

## Updating the Blog Form to Handle Rich Text Editor State Changes

If we type in the rich text editor nothing is happening. That's because we need to keep track of state. In the **blog-form.js** file we'll begin adding another piece of state to the state:

```
this.state = {
  title: "",
  blog_status: "",
  content: ""
};
```

Now we need a function that we'll be passing as a prop to the rich text editor. After binding it to this, we'll create it. It takes an argument of content.

```
handleRichTextEditorChange(content) {
  this.setState({ content });
}
```

> If you set state and the key-value pair is identical you can combne them both.

Now we want to make sure that the form is capturing the data. To do that, we'll update the buildForm function: 

```
buildForm() {
    let formData = new FormData();

    formData.append("portfolio_blog[title]", this.state.title);
    formData.append("portfolio_blog[blog_status]", this.state.blog_status);
    formData.append("portfolio_blog[content]", this.state.content);

    return formData;
}
```

Now we'll pass the function as a prop to the RichTextEditor component:

```
<div className="one-column">
          <RichTextEditor handleRichTextEditorChange={this.handleRichTextEditorChange}/>
        </div>
```

## Retrieving HTML Content from Draft JS Component

Inside the **rich-text-editor.js** file we're going to add a handler.

```
export default class RichTextEditor extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            editorState: EditorState.createEmpty()
        }

        this.onEditorStateChange = this.onEditorStateChange.bind(this)

}
```

Now we'll create the function itself, and it will take the editor state as an argument. We'll pass the function as a prop to the editor itself (it's in the docs for draft-js).

```
 onEditorStateChange(editorState) {
    this.setState({ editorState })
        }

(...)

<Editor
   editorState={this.state.editorState}
   wrapperClassName='demo-wrapper'
   editorClassName='demo-editor'
   onEditorStateChange={this.onEditorStateChange}/>
```

now we're passing this function. It is going to, every time someone starts typing into our rich text editor, it's going to be called and it's going to start triggering a process, so now that we have that, now we can update this function.

The first thing that we're gonna do is call this.setState, and then, we're gonna use the same pattern that we used in the blog form, so editorState is both the name of the key in our state, and it is also the argument that we have here, so we can combine them.

> **this.setState** is not immediate, so it can lead to bugs. However, you can pass a second argument: wait until the state has been updated, and then do other things, and that's when the second argument comes in (in this case, the rich text editor handler, which we passed in as props):

```
onEditorStateChange(editorState); {
            this.setState({ editorState }, this.props.handleRichTextEditorChange(editorState))
        }
```

We can't trust our editor state, or we can't work with it as a string, so what we can do, though, is we can call a few other processes.

So the first thing we need to do is call draftToHtml, what this is going to do is it's going to take the draft.js content and it's going to look through it and it's gonna check to see, okay, this is HTML code. I'm going to take that, and I'm gonna make it into a string, so this is what allows us to take all of that code that we enter in, or the content we type into the editor, and it's going to allow it to be parsed as HTML, so then we can render it and have all the cool formatting things. So that's one part of it.

The next thing is, because we have that object, we have to run a couple of processes on it. One is there is a higher order function called convertToRaw, which we've already imported. This is a function that takes in the code, it takes in the editor code changes, and it parses it into something that we can actually work with. It takes it and it puts it into a raw string, draftToHtml takes that, then, and then wraps it up into HTML string that we can work with.

```
onEditorStateChange(editorState); {
            this.setState({ editorState }, this.props.handleRichTextEditorChange(
                draftToHtml(convertToRaw(this.state.editorState.getCurrentContent()))
            ))
        }
```

**In review**,  let's just review what we've done. We have created a new function called onEditorStateChange. This is passed to the editor as a prop, and it expects that, that's not something that we did or anything that we made up, the draft.js component itself is expecting this prop. Whenever someone starts typing in, this prop is going to be called. They're gonna run the function, they're gonna pass in the new editor state.

From there, we're updating the rich text editor's state value, and then, because we're using this state and passing in a comma, this gives us the ability to ensure that this next process of calling our blog form, that it does not get run until we have actually updated the local state here. From there, we take our content, we convert it to HTML, after it has been, we have gotten the current content, and we've converted it into something we can actually work with.

We have taken out all of the metadata and all of those other functions, and everything like that, and we turned it into a plain string, and then we have that where it can be used as HTML. So quite a bit's going on there. 

Now the text editor is working, but we can't save items yet.

## Fixing Set State on an Unmounted Component Warning in React

As you may or may not have noticed, we are running into a warning whenever we create a new blog. And in this guide, we're gonna see what that warning is, what's causing it, and then also how to fix it.

The error is this one:

```
react-dom.development.js:88 Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method.
    in BlogForm (created by BlogModal)
    in div (created by ModalPortal)
    in div (created by ModalPortal)
```

In the **blog-form.js** file, if you look inside of our handleSubmit method here, you can see that inside of the response, so when the submission is successful and we get the response back, we are calling handleSuccessfullFormSubmission, which is a prop that gets passed down from the blog modal, and then after that, we're calling this.setState.

```
handleSubmit(event) {
    axios
      .post(
        "https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_blogs",
        this.buildForm(),
        { withCredentials: true }
      )
      .then(response => {
        this.props.handleSuccessfullFormSubmission(
          response.data.portfolio_blog
        );

        this.setState({
          title: "",
          blog_status: ""
        });
      })
```

This is the cause of the problem, and the way that you can figure this out is let's work our way up the chain of components and see exactly what's happening here. So when we call handleSuccessfullFormSubmission and we open up the blog-modal, we can see that that's a pretty basic process. It is simply taking in a blog and it's passing it up to the component.

```
handleSuccessfullFormSubmission(blog) {
    this.props.handleSuccessfulNewBlogSubmission(blog);
  }
```

So let's open up the blog component, this is like the grandfather component here, and handleSuccessfulNewBlogSubmission takes in a blog, and then it setState, it adds to the blogItems or adds this new blog to the top. And here is the key, this is the issue. We are setting blogModalIsOpen to false, that triggers a full set of events where it closes the modal. When we close the modal, we also close the form. 

```
handleSuccessfulNewBlogSubmission(blog) {
    this.setState({
      blogModalIsOpen: false,
      blogItems: [blog].concat(this.state.blogItems)
    });
  }

  handleModalClose() {
    this.setState({
      blogModalIsOpen: false
    });
  }
  ```

  And it tries to set state on a component that doesn't exist. To fix this, we're going to grab the setState of the **blog-form.js** file and add content:

  ```
  this.setState({
          title: "",
          blog_status: "",
          content: ""
        });
  ```

  And we're movng all of this above that call:

  ```
  .then(response => {
        this.setState({
          title: "",
          blog_status: "",
          content: ""
        });
        this.props.handleSuccessfullFormSubmission(
          response.data.portfolio_blog
        );

```

Now the issue is resolved.

Now, if you get that error or that warning in another situation where you might have a running process, such as a timer or some type of live API communication, then what you do is then you would follow their advice.

You would create a componentWillUnmount method and then you take each of those subscriptions or those processes, timers, anything like that, and then you cancel those out inside of that function, and then that will fix it as well. So we've talked about two different ways that you can take care of that warning.

## Installing React HTML Parser and Generating Sample Content

Now that our rich text editor is working, it's time to start actually working with the HTML that it gives us.

We'll install a new library:

```
npm i react-html-parser
```

Now to generate a lot of html code we'll create an html file outside the project. We'll use the lorem*NumberOfLines command to generate text, or just go to [this page](https://www.lipsum.com/) and now we can create a new entry.

## Parsing HTML in React and Rendering to the Blog Detail Page

Now that we have the libraries we need, in order to take a string that has HTML in it and convert it and render it onto the screen, let's implement that in our data detail page. And we're also going to clean it up a little bit and fix some of the bugs that you can currently see in there.

In the **blog-detail.js** file, we'll import a library.

```
import ReactHTMLParser from "react-html-parser";
```

Inside of the content div, we'll call it:

```
<div className="content">{ReactHTMLParser(content)}</div>
```

Now all of the HTML is rendered if we enter to the entries.

Now the featured image shouldn't exist when no image is uploaded, so we'll use a ternary operator.

```
{featured_image_url ? (
  <div className="featured-image-wrapper">
    <img src={featured_image_url} />
  </div>
) : null} 
```

However, we can paste that ternary operator in a dedicated functional component. In components > blog, we'll create a new file, **blog-featured-image.js**.

```
const BlogFeaturedImage = props => {
    if (!props.img) {
      return null;
    }
  
  
  
    {featured_image_url ? (
      <div className="featured-image-wrapper">
        <img src={featured_image_url} />
      </div>
    ) : null}
  }
  
  export default BlogFeaturedImage;
```

We can turn that into this:

```
  import React from 'react';

const BlogFeaturedImage = props => {
  if (!props.img) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="featured-image-wrapper">
      <img src={props.img} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default BlogFeaturedImage;
```

And call it inside the blogDetail along with the prop.

```
<h1>{title}</h1>

          <BlogFeaturedImage img={featured_image_url}/>

          <div className="content">{ReactHTMLParser(content)}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
```

## Installing Striptags and Truncate Component in React

Now that we have our HTML rendering properly in our blog detail page, it's time to take a look at the index page and see what we need to do.

I want to take a different approach. One, because I think it will look best, but also so that you can see the other side of working with HTML as strings because this is something you're gonna have to do pretty often.

So, in our index page here, I do not want to simply render out this content as HTML. And the reason for that is because, imagine that you have a piece of content, kinda like our content page right here, that has all of these paragraph tags.

If we try to render this as HTML, you're gonna have blog posts on this summary page that are gonna look really weird. You're gonna have headings, you're gonna have bold and italics, and paragraph tags, and that's not really what I'm wanting to go for. I want this to simply be a set of blog links with summaries.

So, I don't want to render any HTML, I actually want to do the opposite. I want to reach into this set of strings, this HTML code, and I want to take the tags out and then I want to create summaries. And so we're going to walk through, in this guide, how to install the libraries that are going to allow us to do this, and then in the next guide we're gonna implement them.

So we're going to install a couple of libraries:

```
npm i striptags
npm i react-truncate
```

striptags allows to allow (or not) html tags, so you can choose which ones get rendered. Truncate, on the other hand, allows to wrap up content inside it. We can specify the number of lines, can implement a **Read more** link...

## Removing HTML Tags and Generating Summaries for Blogs

Now that we have our script tags and our truncate libraries imported into the application, in this guide we are going to implement them, so this is gonna build out our summaries and also pull out all of those HTML tags so that this looks nice and clean.

Inside the **blog-item.js** file, we'll import truncate and striptags.

```
import striptags from "striptags";
import Truncate from "react-truncate"
```

We're going to call the truncate component inside the render function. This component expects props and children.

```
<Truncate lines={5} ellipsis={}/>
```

The lines prop defines the number of lines of the summary. Ellipsis, on the other hand, gives you the ability to actually pass in any kind of code you want. You could use an icon, you could use a link like we're going to use, or you could use nothing, it's completely up to you. Ellipsis takes just regular HTML.

```
<Truncate lines={5} ellipsis={
        <span>
          ... <Link to={`/b/${id}`}>Read more</Link>
        </span>
      }>{content}</Truncate>
```

Now we have a summary and a read more link that points to the blog detail.

Now we'll pull the tags off, and we'll pass it in the content section:

```
{striptags(content)}</Truncate>
```

Now the tags are gone.

## Customizing the Draft JS Toolbar

In this guide, we are going to start building out the ability to add images into a rich text editor. In the **rich-text-editor.js** file, in the editor component, we're going to pass props. Because we're passing an object, we need a double set of {}. Everything we're going to type now is in the docs for DraftJS.

```
toolbar={{
    inline: { inDropdown: true },
    list: { inDropdown: true },
    textAlign: { inDropdown: true },
    link: { inDropdown: true },
    history: { inDropdown: true },
    image: {
      uploadCallback: this.uploadFile,
      alt: { present: true, mandatory: false },
      previewImage: true,
      inputAccept: "image/gif,image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/svg"
    }
  }}
```

Image takes its own set of arguments.

So inside of the image, I am going to say that we need to have an upload callback. So what this is, is we are going to be able to define a function that is going to run any time an image is added whether we drop the image in, or if we pick it from the file system, so this is uploadCallback.

Now we're going to create a function just above the render method.

```
uploadFile(file) {
    console.log("upload file", file)
  }

render()
```

## Converting Image Files into Base64 Strings

Now that we have customized our icons and we have the structure in place for being able to encode our uploaded images to our text editor, now we are going to start that process.

We're going to create an encoding function which will do a base 64 image conversion. That allows the text editor to enbed images, because they get converted to strings. JS has a native library that can do that called file reader. It works with promises.

In the **rich-text-editor.js** file, just above the uploadFile method, we're going to create a function, and bind it, along with the uploadFile one. Then, inside the new one, we're going to call the file reader:

```
 getBase64(file,callback) {
    let reader = new FileReader()
  }
```

This library is asynchronous, which means that will delay a bit. That's why it uses promises. We'll update the function with a reader instance, and pass in a function to read the file (it gets the file as an object). 


```
 getBase64(file,callback) {
    let reader = new FileReader()
    reader.readAsDataURL(file)
  }
```

From there, we get intro promises.

```
getBase64(file,callback) {
    let reader = new FileReader()
    reader.readAsDataURL(file)
    reader.onload = () => callback 
```

The result portion comes from when we passed the ReadAsDataURL, it started a process that gives a result. We're passing that to the callback.

We'll also catch errors.

```
getBase64(file,callback) {
    let reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    reader.onload = () => callback(reader.result);
    reader.onerror = error => {};
    }
```

Now we're going to update the uploadFile function.

```
uploadFile(file) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.getBase64(file, data => resolve({ data: { link: data } }));
    });
  }
```

Inside the editor component we have the image prop that has the uploadCallback method. This is calling a function called uploadFile whenever an image is dropped inside of it.

UploadFile handles the process of what happens when the image is loaded. It's creating a promise. From there getBase64 is called, a file gets passed, as well as a function, that has an argument of data and the resolve call. Whenever the promise is resolved a set of code is executed. The data portion cames from the base64 function, which runs the callback when it starts  (the callback is the set of code that gets executed as an anonymus function).

## Positioning Draft JS Icons

The modal has some horizontal scrolling. We can prevent this by using scss, but we first need to use the console to get the dropdown class. Then, we're going to get that class and add styles as usual, this time in the **rich-text-editor.scss**.

## Adding Click Handler to Render the BlogForm Component

Over the next few guides, we are going to implement the ability to edit our blog posts, and we're gonna do something that I think is pretty cool, which is we're gonna make it possible for us as admins to simply click on a blog post on the blog detail page in order to start editing it.

Inside the **blog-detail.js** file we're going to add a new piece of state.

```
this.state = {
      currentId: this.props.match.params.slug,
      blogItem: {}, 
      editMode: false
    };
```

The editMode state is set to false by default. If it's false we should see the content, if it's true, we should be able to edit the content.

Now we'll need a handler that's going to take care of that process.

```
handleEditClick() {
  console.log("handle edit clicked");
}
```

Now we can add that function anywhere we want, in this case to the title. Now if we click on titles the console gets updated, we just need to set state now.

```
handleEditClick() {
    console.log("handle edit clicked");
    this.setState({editMode: true})
  }
```

Now we're going to create a variable above the return statement.

```
const contentManager = () => {
      if (this.state.editMode) {
        return <BlogForm/>
      } else {
        return (<div className="content-container">
        <h1 onClick={this.handleEditClick}>{title}</h1>

        <BlogFeaturedImage img={featured_image_url}/>

        <div className="content">{ReactHTMLParser(content)}</div>
      </div>)
      }
    }
```

So if the edit mode is true (the default, that's why there's no value) the blog form is going to show up, if not, the content will show as normal. Inside the blog content we'll call the content manager function.

```
const contentManager = () => {
      if (this.state.editMode) {
        return <BlogForm/>
      } else {
        return (<div className="content-container">
        <h1 onClick={this.handleEditClick}>{title}</h1>

        <BlogFeaturedImage img={featured_image_url}/>

        <div className="content">{ReactHTMLParser(content)}</div>
      </div>)
      }
    }

    return (
      <div className="blog-container">{contentManager()}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

Now if we click on the title the form pops up, but we still have some work to do.

## Passing the Blog Title and Status to the Form to Edit

In the **blog-detail.js** file, now  that clicking on the title enables us to trigger the BlogForm, we can start populating it. We're gonna spend a few guides working through this process.

We'll head to the calling of the blog form. We need that the component knows about edit mode, so we'll pass that as a prop.

```
const contentManager = () => {
      if (this.state.editMode) {
        return <BlogForm editMode={this.state.editMode} blog={this.state.blogItem}/>
```

We'll add a piece of state too, but in the **blog-form.js** file.

```
this.state = {
      id: "",
      title: "",
      blog_status: "",
      content: "",
      featured_image: ""
    };
```

As well as a lifehook to populate data:

```
 componentWillMount() {
    if (this.props.editMode) {
      this.setState({
        id: this.props.blog.id,
        title: this.props.blog.title,
        status: this.props.blog.status
      });
    }
  }
```

> Remember that the props are passed in the **blog-detail** and are called in the **blog-form**.

## How to Programmatically Add Content to Draft JS

Now that we're passing our title and our blog status to our form, we can now extend this and we can start working with our rich text editor.

In the **blog-form.js** file, we'll pass a couple of props to the rich text editor component (We're getting the props from the parent, blog-detail).

```
<div className="one-column">
  <RichTextEditor
    handleRichTextEditorChange={this.handleRichTextEditorChange}
    editMode={this.props.editMode}
```

We also need to pass contentToEdit and add a ternary operator because we don't want to add any details in if we're not in edit mode AND if there's no content.

```
div className="one-column">
  <RichTextEditor
    handleRichTextEditorChange={this.handleRichTextEditorChange}
    editMode={this.props.editMode}
    contentToEdit={this.props.editMode && this.props.blog.content ? this.props.blog.content : null}
  />
```

In the **rich-text-editor.js** file we added an HTMLToDraft library, but we'll need another one.

```
import { EditorState, convertToRaw, ContentState } from "draft-js";
```

We're going to add a ComponentWillMount function. if ther eis content AND we're in edit mode we're going to run a process. All of the code we're going to type is in the DraftJS docs.

First we're going to parse the HTML, so we're going to create a constant. 

```
componentWillMount() {
    if (this.props.editMode && this.props.contentToEdit) {
      const blocksFromHtml = htmlToDraft(this.props.contentToEdit)
    }
  }
```

We're sure that there is content, so now we'll perform de-structuring.

```
componentWillMount() {
    if (this.props.editMode && this.props.contentToEdit) {
      const blocksFromHtml = htmlToDraft(this.props.contentToEdit)
      const {contentBlocks, entityMap} = blocksFromHtml
    }
  }
```

Now we're going to work with the contentState.

```
componentWillMount() {
    if (this.props.editMode && this.props.contentToEdit) {
      const blocksFromHtml = htmlToDraft(this.props.contentToEdit)
      const {contentBlocks, entityMap} = blocksFromHtml
      const ContentState = ContentState.createFromBlockArray(contentBlocks, entityMap)
    }
  }
```

And we'll create another EditorState, but this time with content:

```
componentWillMount() {
    if (this.props.editMode && this.props.contentToEdit) {
      const blocksFromHtml = htmlToDraft(this.props.contentToEdit)
      const {contentBlocks, entityMap} = blocksFromHtml
      const ContentState = ContentState.createFromBlockArray(contentBlocks, entityMap)
      const editorState = EditorState.createWithContent(ContentState)
      this.setState({
        editorState
      })
    }
  }
```

Now we can edit our posts.

## Enabling Dynamic Rendering of the Featured Image in the Blog Form

Now that we have a Rich Text Editor working in Edit mode, it's time to move onto our images. And in the next few guides, we're gonna see how we can remove and work with our featured images with our blogs.

We want to edit a post and to get the image there in order to edit it in the text editor.

We're going to check if we're in edit mode and if the image exists. If so, we're going to render the image.

In the **blog-form.js** file, right under the images-uploader div, we'll set the ternary operator.

```
<div className="image-uploaders">
          {this.props.editMode && this.props.blog.featured_image_url ? <h1>Image goes here</h1> :
          <DropzoneComponent
            ref={this.featuredImageRef}
            config={this.componentConfig()}
            djsConfig={this.djsConfig()}
            eventHandlers={this.handleFeaturedImageDrop()}
          >
            <div className="dz-message">Featured Image</div>
          </DropzoneComponent> }
```

Now if we click on a title with an embeded image (not uploaded via dropzone) the <h1> will appear inside the text field, and the image will be editable via the form. In that case, the dropzone will be visible. If there's a dropzone image, though, we'll have to add the ability to remove the image.

We'll reuse code from the portfolio-form and upload it below what we have:

```
<div className="image-uploaders">
          {this.props.editMode && this.props.blog.featured_image_url ? <h1>Image goes here</h1> :
          <DropzoneComponent
            ref={this.featuredImageRef}
            config={this.componentConfig()}
            djsConfig={this.djsConfig()}
            eventHandlers={this.handleFeaturedImageDrop()}
          >
            <div className="dz-message">Featured Image</div>
          </DropzoneComponent> }
          </div>

          <div className="manager-image-wrapper">
              <img src={this.props.blog.featured_image_url} />

              <div className="image-removal-link">
                <a onClick={() => this.deleteImage("banner_image")}>
                  Remove file
                </a>
              </div>
            </div>
```
