## Building a JavaScript Event Listener for Scroll Events

In the **blog.js** file we're going to create a scroll handler. It's going to be placed above the getBlogItems() method. We'll be using the window method, not the document one, to create this event listener, that will listen to scrolling. This method takes an anonymus function. We'll call it inside the bindings but without binding it to avoid issues for now.

```
 activateInfiniteScroll(){
    window.onscroll = () => {
      console.log("scrolling...");
    }
  }
```

The console now reacts to scrolling.

## Deep dive: innerHeight, scrollTop, and offsetHeight

In the last guide, we walked through the window object in the browser and also how to add a onscroll event listener to be able to track and see whenever a user is scrolling inside of our application.

We'll work with the innerHeight, scrollTop, and offsetHeight properties. Combined, they allow to implement infinite scrolling. These are pure JS properties, they're not tied to react.

* ***window.innerHeight***: It  returns the interior height of the window in pixels, including the height of the horizontal scroll bar, if present. The value of innerHeight is taken from the height of the window's layout viewport. The width can be obtained using the innerWidth property.

If we type ``window.innerHeight`` on the console, we'll get the value in pixels. It's the height of the window.

* ***scrollTop***: The Element.scrollTop property gets or sets the number of pixels that an element's content is scrolled vertically. An element's scrollTop value is a measurement of the distance from the element's top to its topmost visible content. When an element's content does not generate a vertical scrollbar, then its scrollTop value is 0.

* If the element can't be scrolled (e.g. it has no overflow or if the element has a property of "non-scrollable"), scrollTop is 0.

* scrollTop doesn't respond to negative values; instead, it sets itself back to 0.

* If set to a value greater than the maximum available for the element, scrollTop settles itself to the maximum value.

To try this, we'll grab the document instead of the window. This will return the HTML. So we'll type this:

```document.documentElement.scrollTop```.

We'll get a 0 because we haven't scrolled down. If we scroll a bit, we'll get a number.

* ***offsetHeight***: The HTMLElement.offsetHeight read-only property returns the height of an element, including vertical padding and borders, as an integer. 

To try this, we'll type this:

```document.documentElement.offsetHeight```.

This returns the height of the document.

The offsetHeight says something about the height of an element defined by CSS. So if you have an element with height: 100px; then the offsetHeight will be 100.

> offsetHeight is a measurement in pixels of the element's CSS height, including any borders, padding, and horizontal scrollbars (if rendered). It does not include the height of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after. 

If we combine these three we can trigger an infinite scrolling when the user is near the end of the scroll bar.

We can test all of this by typing this:

```
activateInfiniteScroll(){
    window.onscroll = () => {
      console.log("window.innerHeight", window.innerHeight);
      console.log("document.documentElememt.scrollTop", document.documentElement.scrollTop)
      console.log("document.documentElememt.offsetHeight", document.documentElement.offsetHeight)
    }
  }
  ```

  > We can tell when the user hits the bottom of the page by adding the innerHeight + scrollTop, this way we can see how far the user has scrolled down. This sum should give the same value as the offsetHeight.

  Now we'll add a conditional with all of this, for now we'll use a console log. Later on, if no posts are available when reaching the end, we'll implement that logic.

  ```
  activateInfiniteScroll(){
    window.onscroll = () => {
      if (window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop === document.documentElement.offsetHeight)
        console.log("get more posts")
    }
  }
  ```

  > To fix this with different window sizes (cause when reduced, the sum doesn't equal, but it does at full size), type this instead: 

  ```
  activateInfiniteScroll(){
    window.onscroll = () => {
      if (window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop + 1 >
        document.documentElement.offsetHeight)
        console.log("get more posts")
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Getting the Count of Total Records on the Server and Updating the Component State

  > Now that we can work with scroll events and we know the dimensions of the document and of the window size and where the user is scrolling, what we can do is connect that with the ability to go and retrieve more blog records.

  > The very next step is knowing how many total records there are. So, a good example of this is if you are writing a brand new blog, you might have only two blog posts.

> You don't really need the infinite scroll to trigger, because those two are gonna load up, you're gonna get 10 or however many that you get right away. So if there are no more blog records, then the infinite scroll doesn't even need to be triggered.

> So what we're gonna do in this guide is we're gonna see how we can go and look in the data. So we're going to dissect what comes in a little bit more, and we're gonna see how we can use that to update our state and give our component all the knowledge it needs in order to take the next step for building the infinite scroll feature.

**So, in order to start this, in the blog.js file**, we'll update the state:

```
class Blog extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      blogItems: [],
      totalCount: 0,
      currentPage: 0
    };
```

   In the getBlogItems method, we want to make sure that once this is triggered this starts on page one, so we're incrementing the initial state by 1, and this number will increment everytime we reach the bottom of the page. So above the axios call we'll set state:
   ```
   getBlogItems() {
   this.setState({
     currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1
   })
   axios
   ```
   Now we need to know how many records are on the API server. To do this, we'll call the debugger right below the then calling of the getBlogItems method. This will stop the execution of the code.

   ```
   getBlogItems() {
   this.setState({
     currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1
   })
   axios
     .get("https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_blogs", {
       withCredentials: true
     })
     .then(response => {
       debugger;
       this.setState({
  ```

 If we type response on the console, all the objects will be displayed.

  > Do it with a console log, otherwise won't work. Inside of the object we'll go to **data** and from there to **portfolio_blogs** to get the objects (just explaining where did we get things earlier), but in this case we'll go to **meta**. There, we can find a **total_records** tag.

  We need to tell the system how many records are there to later implement the logic (perhaps we don't want to launch the infinite scrolling if no records are available).

  We'll now traverse the branches. In the setState part of the promise above, we'll call these objects and assign them to the totalCount variable, so we get this:

  ```
  getBlogItems() {
    this.setState({
      currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1
    })
    axios
      .get("https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_blogs", {
        withCredentials: true
      })
      .then(response => {
        console.log("datos en consola", response)
        this.setState({
          blogItems: response.data.portfolio_blogs,
          totalCount: response.data.meta.total_ecords

        })
      })
      .catch(error => {
   ```

 > Once again, the exact placement of the data depends on the API.

 ## Implementing an Animated Data Loading Icon in React

 Letting the user know that the page is loading is crucial, so we'll do that now by implementing an animated icon when the infinite scroll is loading more content.

 We'll open the **blog.js** file. We need to keep track of the state to see if the page is loading or not. So we'll add an initial state: 

 ```
 class Blog extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      blogItems: [],
      totalCount: 0,
      currentPage: 0,
      isLoading: true
    };
```

We cannot mantain this state forever, though. Inside the getBlogItems method, inside the then promise, we'll set it to false because by now the response already came in, so no loading icon will be needed.

```
getBlogItems() {
    this.setState({
      currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1
    })
    axios
      .get("https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_blogs", {
        withCredentials: true
      })
      .then(response => {
        console.log("datos en consola", response)
        this.setState({
          blogItems: response.data.portfolio_blogs,
          totalCount: response.data.meta.total_ecords, 
          isLoading: false
  ```

  Now we'll open the **app.js** file to import a new icon. We'll also import it from the **blog.js** file.

  ```
import {FontAwesomeIcon} from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";
  
  <div className="blog-container">
          <div><FontAwesomeIcon icon="spinner"></FontAwesomeIcon></div>
          <div className="content-container">{blogRecords}</div>
  ```

We need to make the icon spin. To do so, we'll just pass a reserved word/prop to the call of the icon: 

```
<div><FontAwesomeIcon icon="spinner" spin></FontAwesomeIcon></div>
```

Now the icon will be spinning, and we can add styles too. We'll create a scss file called loaders and will also add a div with a class: 

```
<div className="content-loader">
    <div><FontAwesomeIcon icon="spinner" spin></FontAwesomeIcon></div>
  </div>
```

We want this icon to appear below the blog records, so we'll move it down (if we do that the icon will also show up on the upper part of the page till the content is loaded). It will be shown everytime the content is loading. In other words, we want this to show up **if** the content is loading.

So we'll use a ternary operator:

```
render() {
    const blogRecords = this.state.blogItems.map(blogItem => {
      return <BlogItem key={blogItem.id} blogItem={blogItem} />
    })
    return (
        <div className="blog-container">
          <div className="content-container">{blogRecords}</div>
      
          {this.state.isLoading ? (
          <div className="content-loader">
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon="spinner" spin />
          </div>) : null}
        </div>
      );
  }
}

export default Blog;
```

## Building the Full Infinite Scroll Functionality in React

In the **blog.js** file, we'll first test what will happen if we call the getBlogItems method inside the activateInfinite Scroll method. Everytime we hit the end of the scroll bar the API is called to get more posts.

And this works because we get the console logs that are inside the promise, but we want the next items. To do this,

We'll add optional parameters to the API call url.

```
getBlogItems() {
    this.setState({
      currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1
    })
    axios
      .get(`https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_blogs?page=${this
          .state.currentPage}`, {
        withCredentials: true
      })
      .then(response => {
        console.log("datos en consola", response.data)
```

As we're calling ``currentPage.state``, the page is incremented by 1 every time the ``getBlogItems`` method is called.

Now the screen will be blank when we reach the end due to a bug, and also the console would load the new posts on top of the old ones because the state is being overwritten, and that's not what we want, we want to concat the new results to the old ones.

So we'll type this: 

```
getBlogItems() {
    this.setState({
      currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1
    })
    axios
      .get(`https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_blogs?page=${this
          .state.currentPage}`, {
        withCredentials: true
      })
      .then(response => {
        console.log("datos en consola", response.data)
        this.setState({
          blogItems: this.state.blogItems.concat(response.data.portfolio_blogs),
```

Now we want to asure that the infinite scroll doesn't load whenever there aren't new posts to load. We need to add validations for that.

So we'll type this:

```
activateInfiniteScroll() {
    if (this.state.blogItems.length === this.state.totalCount) {
      return;
    }

    window.onscroll = () => {
      if (window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop + 1 >
        document.documentElement.offsetHeight)
        this.getBlogItems();
    }
  }
  ```

  > In JavaScript, whenever you're in a function like we're in right now, if you just type return, Javascript will return and break out of that entire function.So what we're wanting to do is say if the totalCount is already there, if the blogItems is equal to that count, I want you to skip everything else below this and so that's the behavior that this will give us.

If the state in that conditional hasn't updated and the user has scrolled down too quickly the system will try to call the API again.

To fix this, we can call the ``isLoading```state using the pipes:

```
activateInfiniteScroll() {
    if (this.state.isLoading || this.state.blogItems.length === this.state.totalCount) {
      return;
    }
```

So whenever the page is loading or the condition is fulfilled, the system won't call new items, because the isLoading state only turns false when the getBlogItems method is called.

## Refactoring the Infinite Scroll Feature to Fix Memory Leak

The feature might be working properly, however, we have created what is called a memory leak. It does not happen in all use cases and so if you go all the way down and you view all of the records, this bug is not going to appear, it's still gonna be behind the scenes, but it's not going to appear. So if you just load the page and then say go to the homepage or the portfolio manager, one of the taller pages and let that page load.

And watch what happens in the console if I scroll all the way down. I'm gonna scroll all the way down and uh oh, we have a big warning and then we have something very confusing, we actually went out and grabbed our portfolio blogs again.

That's becuse we're attaching the scroll event to the window, so the browser, when the system loads another component, that listener is still there even though we're in another page.

In the **blog.js** file we're going to take out the ``onScroll``listener from the ``activateInfiniteScroll`` method to put it inside the constructor. So we'll first rename the method because now it will just react to scrolling, so now will be renamed to ``onScroll()```, so we get this:

```
onScroll() {
      if (
        this.state.isLoading ||
        this.state.blogItems.length === this.state.totalCount
      ) {
        return;
      }

      if (
        window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop + 1 >
        document.documentElement.offsetHeight
      ) {
        this.getBlogItems();
      }
  }
```
> Don't forget to bind the method to this.

Now we'll add the event listener inside the constructor.

```
window.addEventListener("scroll", this.onScroll, false)
```

The first argument is the type of the event, the second element the function that will react to scrolling **WITHOUT PARENTHESES AND CALLED WITH THIS**, and the third one will be a boolean (false, but the boolean is optional).

We'll now create a ``ComponentWillUnmount`` lifecycle hook. When the component goes away any functions inside will trigger, so we can add a ``window.RemoveEventListener`` to fix the memory leak:

```
componentWillMount() {
    this.getBlogItems();
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener("scroll", this.onScroll, false)
  }
```

Now the bug is fixed and the feature is working.
