## Building a JavaScript Event Listener for Scroll Events

In the **blog.js** file we're going to create a scroll handler. It's going to be placed above the getBlogItems() method. We'll be using the window method, not the document one, to create this event listener, that will listen to scrolling. This method takes an anonymus function. We'll call it inside the bindings but without binding it to avoid issues for now.

```
 activateInfiniteScroll(){
    window.onscroll = () => {
      console.log("scrolling...");
    }
  }
```

The console now reacts to scrolling.
