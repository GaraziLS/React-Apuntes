## Initial Build Out of the Portfolio Detail Component

So, we already have a PortfolioDetail component in our application, but we're not calling it from anywhere and we're not directing users to it yet, so in this guide, that's what we're going to do.

In the **app.js** file, if we look at the portfolio/:slug route, we'll see that we're calling the PortfolioDetail, so we'll go to the *portfolio-detail.js* file. There, we'll see that it is a functional component. To redirect users to the items, we need to go to the *home.js* file, where the <u>PortfolioContainer</u> component is. If we go to the <u>PortfolioContainer</u> we'll see that it imports <u>PortfolioItem</u>. It's there where we will add the link to the details, and where we will make the portfolio items clickable.

```
return (
      <Link to={`/portfolio/${id}`}>
```

> The closing Link tag must be put at the end of the code, wrapping the entire return statement.

Now that the links work, we must connect the portfolio details to the API and run a few processes. We need an event to launch when the event launches, so we need to convert this functional compoment into a class component.

```
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class PortfolioDetail extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Portfolio Detail for {this.props.match.params.slug}</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now we'll call the API.

```
 getPortfolioItem() {
    axios
      .get(`https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_items/${this.props.match.params.slug}`, 
        { withCredentials: true }
      )
      .then(response => {
        console.log("res", response);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log("getportfolioitem error", error);
      });

  }
```

Now we'll create the lifehook:

```
componentWillMount() {
  this.getPortfolioItem();
}
```
