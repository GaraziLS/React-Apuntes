## Initial Build Out of the Portfolio Detail Component

So, we already have a PortfolioDetail component in our application, but we're not calling it from anywhere and we're not directing users to it yet, so in this guide, that's what we're going to do.

In the **app.js** file, if we look at the portfolio/:slug route, we'll see that we're calling the PortfolioDetail, so we'll go to the *portfolio-detail.js* file. There, we'll see that it is a functional component. To redirect users to the items, we need to go to the *home.js* file, where the <u>PortfolioContainer</u> component is. If we go to the <u>PortfolioContainer</u> we'll see that it imports <u>PortfolioItem</u>. It's there where we will add the link to the details, and where we will make the portfolio items clickable.

```
return (
      <Link to={`/portfolio/${id}`}>
```

> The closing Link tag must be put at the end of the code, wrapping the entire return statement.

Now that the links work, we must connect the portfolio details to the API and run a few processes. We need an event to launch when the event launches, so we need to convert this functional compoment into a class component. Now we must call the this portion before the props.

```
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class PortfolioDetail extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Portfolio Detail for {this.props.match.params.slug}</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now we'll call the API.

```
 getPortfolioItem() {
    axios
      .get(`https://garazils.devcamp.space/portfolio/portfolio_items/${this.props.match.params.slug}`, 
        { withCredentials: true }
      )
      .then(response => {
        console.log("response", response);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log("getportfolioitem error", error);
      });

  }
```

Now we'll create the lifehook:

```
componentWillMount() {
  this.getPortfolioItem();
}
```

## Rendering the Portfolio Detail Data on the Screen

To render the content on the screen it's helpful to console log everything. We'll copy the entire data object that appears on the console.

In the **portfolio-detail.js** file, in the getPortfolioItem method, we'll set state passing in what the console returned. That same state will be empty in the base state:

```
this.state = {
      portfolioItem: {}
    }

    (...)

.then(response => {
       this.setState({
        portfolioItem: response.data.portfolio_item
       })
```

Inside the render method we'll paste what we copied from the console and perfom de-structuring, just for following an ordered process.

So we would get this:

```
const {
      banner_image_url,
      category,
      description,
      logo_url,
      name,
      thumb_image_url,
      url
    } = this.state.portfolioItem
```

So now inside the h2 we can dynamically generate things.

```
const {
      banner_image_url,
      category,
      description,
      logo_url,
      name,
      thumb_image_url,
      url
    } = this.state.portfolioItem
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        <p>{description}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Portfolio detail styles

  We'll start in the **portfolio-detail.js** page adding classes and styles as usual, in its own dedicated style sheet. To populate the image, right below the de-structuring, we're going to give inline styles.

  ```
  const bannerStyles = {
  backgroundImage: "url(" + banner_image_url + ")",
  backgroundSize: "cover",
  backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat",
  backgroundPosition: "center center"
}
```

Now we have to call the constant, and we'll do it inside the return:

```
return (
  <div className="portfolio-detail-wrapper">
    <div className="banner" style={bannerStyles}>
      <img src={logo_url} />
    </div>
```
