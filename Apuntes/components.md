## Components

To use components you first need to import react at the very top. Components are not mandatory. 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
```
> ### A note on curly brackets
>
> Curly brackets are needed when you are specifically picking out a library that has not been exported by default.
> 
> In the app.js (inside src) there's a line of *export default class App*. What this means is that some other file (Bootstrap) is importing the file:
> 
> ```
> import App from "./components/app";
> ```
> We do not use the curly brackets there and the reason for that is, because whenever you have an export default, what that means is that you're just pulling in the file, and you're treating the entire file like one library and then you can call it whatever you want. 
> 
> Whenever you're using these curly brackets, that would be kind of akin to saying, "I want to simply export the ClassApp, not default." Then you have to be very specific, and you have to put in curly braces, and you have to name it.

If you're using a component you need a render() method. This method has a return statement that returns what's shown on the page.

```
export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='app'>
        <h1>Some content</h1>
        <h2>{moment().format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a')}</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Create components

* Inside the src > components folder, create a new file.

* Then, import react (and non-defaulted components) from its module, and create a class with *export default class + the Class name*. This class (highlighted in green) extends (creates a child) a Component. Inside of there, between curly brackets, there's a render method that has a return statement that contains, between (), JSX (looks like HTML). This return statement is what's rendered on the page after calling it in the app.

```
import React, {Component} from "react";

export default class PortfolioContainer extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Portfolio Container</h2>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

* To render this on the page it's necessary to call it from the app.js file, but you first need to import it.


* It's a best practice to import things from your own code separated from the libraries imports. This is done by importing the component's name and by specifying its path. Remember to use the export method inside the component that will be imported.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import moment from "moment"

import PortfolioContainer from './portfolio-components/portfolio-container';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='app'>
        <h1>Some Content</h1>
        <PortfolioContainer/>
        <h2>{moment().format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a')}</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
* After importing a component you call it in the app. To do so, type its name between < />

## Class vs Functional (also presentational) components

Class components are class-based components, like the ones above. Functional (or presentational) components, on the other hand, are function-based and look like this:

```
import React from "react";

export default function() {
    return(
        <div><h3>Portfolio item</h3></div>
    )
}
```
Now we're gonna export it to the container, which in turn is imported from the app file:

```
import React, {Component} from "react";

import PortfolioItem from "./portfolio-item"

export default class PortfolioContainer extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Portfolio Container</h2>
                <PortfolioItem/>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

A functional component, despite being written with less code, is less functional. To work with states and lifecycles class components are needed. To simply render content, functional components are more than enough.

Functional components such as the portfolio item will only store data, not images, links, etc. That's for the class components.

### Constructors inside class components

Constructors allow to automate processes and can only be used inside class components. They allow to give a component an initial state, and look like this:

```
export default class PortfolioContainer extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super(); 
            console.log("All the portfolio items have been loaded")
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Portfolio Container</h2>
                <PortfolioItem/>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```
Classes extend from components, so the super method allows to call the parent class.

### Custom functions in React and looping

Looping through data and then rendering it is quite common, to avoid hardcoding and to generate things dynamically.

To do this in React we'll use the map function, so we might have this: data, with the map function, that has a key and an arrow function inside it as arguments:

> The map function always returns something. 
> Item is prefixed with an undercore because otherwise it is never read despite being declared.

```
portfolioItems() {
        const data = ["First", "Second", "Third"];
        return data.map(_item => {
            return <PortfolioItem/>; })
    }
```

Yes, in react you can return components inside functions.

In order to render this we need to use curly brackets, because when you want to slide some JavaScript code into your render function here, you need to use curly brackets, and we are rendering the function that has a component inside it:

```
 portfolioItems() {
        const data = ["First", "Second", "Third"];
        return data.map(_item => {
            return <PortfolioItem/>;
        })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Portfolio Container</h2>
                <div>{portfolioItems()}</div> // <---- Functional component called via function with curly brackets
            </div>
        )
    }
```

Now that would return a component, but if we do this

```
portfolioItems() {
        const data = ["First", "Second", "Third"];
        return data.map(_item => {
            return <h1>{_item}</h1>;
        })
    }

```

We get the data looped.

### Props (properties)

Props (short for properties) are the way that you can pass data from one parent component to a child component. 
 The very first thing that we're going to do when you're passing in a prop is the syntax for that is to define it directly in line with the component. 

 ```
 portfolioItems() {
        const data = ["First", "Second", "Third"];
        return data.map(_item => {
            return <PortfolioItem title={_item}/>; // component and prop with the _item inside
        })
    }
```

We now need the component itself to be able to render the prop in the page. To do this we must go to the component and inside the function pass the prop element via the reserved word props:

```
export default function(props) {
    return(
        <div><h3>{props}</h3></div>
    )
}
```

However this will throw an error because props is an object and objects aren't valid as react children. We need to call the prop itself (the tag, not the content) inside the component too:

```
export default function(props) {
    return(
        <div><h3>{props.title}</h3>
        <h4>{props.url}</h4></div>
    )
}
```

And this will return each item again, and the specified url: 

```
First
www.google.es
Second
www.google.es
Third
www.google.es
```

### JSX

This compiler converts data into something all browsers can handle. When creating a component in react, this is what JSX does:

# Deep Dive: Component Lifecycle in React

**Mounting**: Here, we're picking out what kinds of data and processes need to occur when that component is going to load, with all the processes that will occur when someone navigates to that component. That's the mounting process and it's that first stage kind of like when we're going to the drive-thru and we're starting to pick out what we want to order.

**Updating**: If when we order something there isn't that kind of item we can change our minds and place enother order. In code terms, that would be like filling forms or something. If only one component needs to be updated out of eight, we can update just one.

**Unmounting**: Once we place our order we pay, receive food and go away. That's the *unmounting* process.

WeÂ´ll start by adding routing. This will allow to hide (unmount) components when others are loaded. Simply put it will be a way of jumping between links.

Briefly put, to create a link navigation system in react we need:

1. To go to the entrypoint, go to src > index.js, and wrap the app component inside of a browser router.

2. Create a navlink page that will wrap all the links that will point to different "pages". They will point to routes.

3. To switch between links, create a page that will dsplay the content. Use a switch tag and specify the path.

4. Export components to the app file.

To do so, go to components > src and create a file (name it however you want).

After exporting this component to the App file, go to the entry point (src > index.js), and wrap the app component inside of a browser router (and import the BrowserRouter):

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {BrowserRouter, Route, Link} from "react-router-dom";

import App from './components/app';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter> // <---- Wrapper
  <App />
  </BrowserRouter>, // <---- Wrapper
  document.querySelector('.app-wrapper'));
  ```
  This will show and hide one component and hide the others, allowing us to jump between links.

  Now we'll create another file inside the components, *navigaton.js*, where all of the links will be:

  ```
  import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function()  {
        return (
        <div>
            <NavLink exact to= "/">
            Discussion
            </NavLink>
        </div>
        );
    };
```

The NavLink component is provided by React. The exact prop specifies the route to which the link will point (the slash indicates a homepage) and must be wrapped by NavLink tags. This way we can jump between components.

To make the jumps, we'll type:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
```
And then we'll import the workflow, rules and discussion pages here as well.

To make the switches between links, we'll use:

```
export default function() {
        return (
        <div>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path="/" component={Discussion}/>
                <Route exact path="/rules" component={Rules}/>
                <Route exact path="/lifecycle_workflow" component={Workflow}/>
            </Switch>
        </div>
        );
    };
```

Where the switch tag encapsulates the routes.

Now we have to import the page content and the navlink files from the app.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import Navigation from './navigation';
import PageContent from './page-content';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
    <div>
         <Navigation/>
         <PageContent/>
    </div>
    );
  };
}
```
